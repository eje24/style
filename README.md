Temporary container for eje.sty. Heavily based off of chez.sty.

To-do:
1. do numbered tcolorbox numbered environments
2. do regular numbered environments
3. implement current problem + current pset with pset/problem counters
3. san serif (formal mode)
4. get rid of extra ifs

Far-future:
- add in algorithm support
- add in minted support (for python and similar)
