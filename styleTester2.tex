\section{Heading on Level Zero}

\rightmark The goal of these notes is to explain the classification of real representations of a finite
group. Throughout, $G$ is a finite group, $W$ is a \RR-vector space or \RR G-module, and $V$ is a
\CC-vector space or \CC G-module (except in Section 2, where $V$ is over any field). Vector spaces
and representations are assumed to be finite-dimensional.

To get from $\RR^n$ to $\CC^n$, we can tensor with \CC. In a more coordinate-free
manner, if $W$ is an \RR-vector space, then its \obold{complexification} $W_{\CC} := W \otimes_{\RR} \CC$ is a \CC-vector
space. We can view $W$ as an \RR-subspace of $W_{\CC}$ by identifying each $w \in W$ with $w \otimes 1 \in W_{\CC}$.
Then an \RR-basis of $W$ is also a \CC-basis of $W_{\CC}$. In particular, $W_{\CC}$ has the same dimension as
$W$ (but is a vector space over a different field).

Conversely, we can view \CC[n] as $\RR^{2n}$ if we forget how to multiply by complex scalars that are not real. In a more coordinate-free manner, then its \obold{restriction of scalars} is the \RR-vector space $_{\RR} V$ with the same underlying abelian group but with only scalar multiplication by real numbers. If $v_1,\dots,v_n$ is a \CC-basis of $V$, then $v_1, iv_1,\dots,v_n,iv_n$ is an \RR-basis of $_{\RR} V$. In particular, $\dim(_{\RR} V) = 2\dim V$.

Also, if $V$ is a \CC-vector space, then the \obold{complex conjugate vector space} $\ol{V}$ has the same underlying group but a new scalar multiplication $\cdot$ defined by $\lambda\cdot v := \ol{\lambda}v$, where $\ol{\lambda}v$ is defined using the origial scalar multiplication.

Complexification and restriction of scalars are not inverse constructions. Instead:
\begin{proposition}[Complexification and restriction of scalars.]
    \hfill
    \begin{enumerate}[font=\normalfont]
        \item If $V$ is a \CC-vector space, then the map \begin{align*}
            (_{\RR} V)_{\CC} &\rightarrow V \oplus \ol{V} \\
            v\otimes c &\mapsto (cv,\ol{c}v) \\
        \end{align*} is an isomorphism of \CC-vector spaces.
        \item If $W$ is an \RR-vector space, then \[_{\RR}(W_{\CC}) \simeq W\oplus W.\]
    \end{enumerate}

Then an \RR-basis of $W$ is also a \CC-basis of $W_{\CC}$. In particular, $W_{\CC}$ has the same dimension as
$W$ (but is a vector space over a different field).

Also, if $V$ is a \CC-vector space, then the \obold{complex conjugate vector space} $\ol{V}$ has the same underlying group but a new scalar multiplication $\cdot$ defined by $\lambda\cdot v := \ol{\lambda}v$, where $\ol{\lambda}v$ is defined using the origial scalar multiplication.

\section{The third section}


The goal of these notes is to explain the classification of real representations of a finite
group. Throughout, $G$ is a finite group, $W$ is a \RR-vector space or \RR G-module, and $V$ is a
\CC-vector space or \CC G-module (except in Section 2, where $V$ is over any field). Vector spaces
and representations are assumed to be finite-dimensional.

To get from $\RR^n$ to $\CC^n$, we can tensor with \CC. In a more coordinate-free
manner, if $W$ is an \RR-vector space, then its \obold{complexification} $W_{\CC} := W \otimes_{\RR} \CC$ is a \CC-vector
space. We can view $W$ as an \RR-subspace of $W_{\CC}$ by identifying each $w \in W$ with $w \otimes 1 \in W_{\CC}$.
Then an \RR-basis of $W$ is also a \CC-basis of $W_{\CC}$. In particular, $W_{\CC}$ has the same dimension as
$W$ (but is a vector space over a different field).

Conversely, we can view \CC[n] as $\RR^{2n}$ if we forget how to multiply by complex scalars that are not real. In a more coordinate-free manner, then its \obold{restriction of scalars} is the \RR-vector space $_{\RR} V$ with the same underlying abelian group but with only scalar multiplication by real numbers. If $v_1,\dots,v_n$ is a \CC-basis of $V$, then $v_1, iv_1,\dots,v_n,iv_n$ is an \RR-basis of $_{\RR} V$. In particular, $\dim(_{\RR} V) = 2\dim V$.

Also, if $V$ is a \CC-vector space, then the \obold{complex conjugate vector space} $\ol{V}$ has the same underlying group but a new scalar multiplication $\cdot$ defined by $\lambda\cdot v := \ol{\lambda}v$, where $\ol{\lambda}v$ is defined using the origial scalar multiplication.

Complexification and restriction of scalars are not inverse constructions. Instead:
\begin{proposition}[Complexification and restriction of scalars.]
    \hfill
    \begin{enumerate}[font=\normalfont]
        \item If $V$ is a \CC-vector space, then the map \begin{align*}
            (_{\RR} V)_{\CC} &\rightarrow V \oplus \ol{V} \\
            v\otimes c &\mapsto (cv,\ol{c}v) \\
        \end{align*} is an isomorphism of \CC-vector spaces.
        \item If $W$ is an \RR-vector space, then \[_{\RR}(W_{\CC}) \simeq W\oplus W.\]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
